Hey, this is my first blog post and I am very exited and also kind of worried about it, haha.

My name is **Mohamamd Haroon Azizi**, I am from Afghanistan, and I currently live in this beautiful country too. I love technology and I have been fascinated by it for years. I always wondered how things work and what are inside things.

I remember a time when I was about 10 years old—I took apart a perfectly fine 8MP camera that only needed a battery change. For some reason, I decided to open it anyway. Maybe I thought reassembling it would be just as easy as taking it apart. I was wrong. I ended up completely destroying the camera, and my dad was furious.

As the years passed, my curiosity only grew—I kept taking things apart, eager to understand how they worked. I had a deep love for computers, mostly for playing GTA Vice City, but also for their endless possibilities. Between 2014 and 2016, I would activate a 1GB internet plan on my SIM card and use almost all of it to watch tech reviews and explore topics like hacking and cybersecurity.

By 2017-2018, I started taking security more seriously and created my own Telegram channel. I shared technology-related content, including tips on making Facebook accounts with stylish names—back when those weird-looking characters were considered cool. I connected with a lot of online friends, and together, our channels had over 50,000 members.

Looking back, I can confidently say I was one of the first tech content creators in Afghanistan. But then, things changed. COVID hit, and with the Kankor exam (Afghanistan’s nationwide university entrance test) just two years away, I had to shift my focus to my studies.

Things work differently in Afghanistan—not necessarily for better or worse, just different. My father, a dentist, wanted me to follow in his footsteps, and both my parents strongly encouraged me to pursue a career in medicine. They insisted that I choose a medical field on the Kankor exam, but I didn’t score high enough for that. Instead, I was accepted into the _Architectural Engineering Faculty of Nangarhar University_.

The ironic part? I took the exam in the final days of the _Islamic Republic of Afghanistan_, just before the _Taliban_ took over. By the time my results were announced, _Kabul had already fallen_. For security reasons, my parents didn’t allow me to attend.

Once again, my parents—and even my grandfather—urged me to pursue a medical career. To be fair, they had valid reasons. In Afghanistan, doctors are well-paid and highly respected. But I never cared about status or following the expected path. I didn’t just want to change a life or even a hundred—_I wanted to impact millions_.

That said, I don’t even know how to change my own life yet. But I hold onto the hope that, before it’s too late, I’ll figure out a way to change mine—and maybe _millions_ of others.

## My life, now

I’m currently in my third year of studying Computer Science at **Kardan University**, which many consider the best university in Afghanistan. If all goes well, by this time next year, I’ll have completed my degree and officially stepped into my professional career.

Despite still being a student, I’ve already worked on numerous projects—both for myself and for others. One of my most recent accomplishments is a **clinic manager app** I built for my dad. Now, I plan to sell it to other dentists as well. Fortunately, my dad has a strong network in the field, and I’ll be seeking his help to connect with potential buyers.

I also developed a web app called **Aadat**, which blends a habit tracker with a GitHub-style contribution graph.

Beyond that, I’m working on something much bigger—a mobile application. I started learning React Native a while ago, but since I was mostly watching a Coursera course without working on real-life projects, I didn’t progress as much as I wanted.
My goal is to complete the app by the end of March 2025. I’ll be relying on AI, YouTube tutorials, documentation, and whatever else it takes to get it done. I truly believe this app can make a _meaningful_ difference in people’s lives—and hopefully, it will help me sustain myself financially as well.

## Last notes

This blog marks the beginning of something new for me. I’ll be sharing my learnings—not just about technology, but also about life and everything in between. I read 10 to 12 books a year, listen to countless podcasts, and watch a ton of YouTube videos, so this will be my space to document and share insights from all of it.

I have a feeling 2025 is going to be legen _… wait for it…_ dary. Legendary. (If you know, you know.)

For now, I’m still financially dependent on my parents, which isn’t ideal—but they’re completely fine with it. As I’ve said before, things work differently in Afghanistan. Still, I want to build something of my own, earn my own money, and cover my expenses independently.

At 21 (soon to be 22 on February 15), I’ve had some incredible experiences—working at one of Afghanistan’s most-watched TV stations, managing events at a local TED event, studying two semesters at the University of Cambridge (online), and much more.

That’s a little about me for now. **Thanks for reading!**
