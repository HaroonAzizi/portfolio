Hey readers, thanks for choosing to read about me.

Today is my twenty-first birthday, **here are 10 lessons I learned in my time on Earth:**

### 1- The only constant in life is change

Things will change, even if we don’t want them to. That’s how life works. I won’t have the energy of my twenties in my thirties, I won’t have as much time as I do right now, and I won’t be the same person I am today.

Everything changes—just embrace it.

### 2- There's no risk in taking risks

You may think I’m crazy, but after observing the world and seeing all the successful people, I’ve realized that without taking risks, there’s no success.

At this stage of my life, I’m going to take risks, pursue the things I’ve wanted to do for a long time but was too scared to try. I will either make it and have a legendary story, or I won’t—but I’ll still have a great story to tell.

### 3- Read more

It doesn’t matter what you read—just read something useful. A book, an article, a blog—whatever. Reading has changed the way I see the world. If you’re new to reading, start with **The Almanack of Naval Ravikant**.

### 4- Be helpful for no reason

There’s something deeply fulfilling about helping someone for no reason, giving free advice, making people laugh, and being humble.

### 5- Make your habits your identity

My resolution for 2025 was to code every day of the year—or at least 300+ days. I know it’s hard to maintain, but if I stick to it and make “being a programmer” my identity, it will be easier.

Start from the first day of the year, the first day of the month, or even the first day of the week, and just stick to it. Here’s my GitHub contribution graph from 2025 (I haven't missed a day since the beginning of the year):

### 6- Try new things

Trying different things makes for great stories in the future. I’ve worked at a TV station, uploaded to YouTube, paid for X/Twitter Premium, worked on different projects, participated in ICPC, been involved in TV ads, and now I’m blogging in 2025—haha.

This year, I’ll try even more things. I plan to start _my own business_, find freelance jobs, and maybe even return to YouTube.

### 7- Control your anger

I have a short temper and struggle with controlling my anger. This year, I will do my best to find ways to manage it and avoid hurting people with my words.

We have a saying in Persian: _“A broken glass can be fixed, but a broken heart will always be broken.”_

This will be a real challenge for me because I’ve hurt many people with words I didn’t mean.

### 8- Eight hours of work is for those with no dreams

I never believed in 8 hours sleep, 8 hours work and 8 hours rest concept. Working only 8 hours per day won't give me my dreams. Try to work more than that if you truly believe in your dream. You can always slow that down when you'll get it.

### 9- Don’t just think about making money—think about changing the world

The people who changed the world weren’t much different from us. They simply stuck to what they believed in, wanted to make a positive impact, and worked relentlessly toward it.

### 10- Life is too short to be small

Life is short, and time flies faster than we realize. If we live in fear, play it safe, and never push beyond our limits, we will look back with regret. Instead of thinking small, dream big, take action, and make an impact.
