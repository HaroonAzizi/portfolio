Hi, this is Haroon - founder of code.af and Hadaf app.

Life has been pretty stressful lately. From late nights working to managing the people I work with and making business plans and strategies for both of my brands, Hadaf and code.af (yeah, I like to write it all in lowercase).

There always are problems and issues facing us and making us get slower or even make us stop in some cases. I have faced a lot of those in recent months. University on one side, work on the other and trying to build an idea that has never been experimented before in Afghanistan is on the other side. The idea of Hadaf is not new, the thing that is new about it is the simplificaiton. The way I managed to design the platform to make it simpler for Afghans to learn one on one classes.

The first idea of Hadaf (https://had.af) at the start was to just be for the Afghans who are living outside the country and want their kids to learn Afghan languages, culture and Islamic studies. But then I figured, I have created a beast already. It works super cool and it is along with the top five most beautifully designed Afghan apps ever (yeah, that's just a claim but I really feel like it is like that. You'll see what I mean once I get the app out there - wait for a month, I guess). When I figured that out I wanted to expand the number of people we will serve. Now my idea is to make Hadaf the host of all the online classes in Afghanistan (and potentially outside the country - I may have some good news about this but can't say anything right now).

But what we will start the Hadaf platform with will be online classes on the mentioned subjects. I have a very cool marketing strategy in mind for that and I really think that will work very well. For the app itself I have stayed late nights coding, making business plans, pricing tiers, and thinking about it.

To be completely honest, for me Hadaf isn't here to only make a few bucks and that's it. I really feel like I could change the way Afghanistan's educational system works with this app. I have a big vision for it, to make the education accessible for everyone - specially the Afghan girls who are banned from attending to formal educational places. I have a very big vision for the app and I already have its strategy, what I need is a little bit of luck and a proper execution.

The initial title of this blog was "Life, lately", because I wanted to share about my life and also clear my mind. But when I'm thinking of life, the only things that come to my mind are code.af and Hadaf. I have invested so much of my time on them that I barely remember any other parts of my life for past few months. I know, it sounds crazy, but _it is what it is_ (only one person knows why i said this).

Anyways, it is my last semester in university and while it gets kind of boring, but I know for a fact that I will miss it. Because I'll have to be more responsible with my life, the journey of becoming an entrepernuer will get even lonlier because going to Kardan is and was almost the only time of the day I'll get outside. But yeah, that's how life works, every beginning has an ending and everything ends. The good point is that I have had a very cool time in there. I made great friends there, I got to know a lot of cool people, I went to a lot of cool places and I made some cool stuff. One thing that I will never forget is that I worked at the Ariana Television Network (ATN). Yeah. A computer science major working at a TV as a producer - haha. I was an intern in there at first, but then I got a job offer and some things happend and I couldn't take the offer. But yeah, working there was one of the coolest memories on my university time. Deep down I secretly wish that working there will be my last job, because I really think that I will be more useful to myself and the people around me if I made my own business and if I worked on my own company.

This exact blog feels like a mess, but I am going to publish it either way just to get the things that have been in my mind out and also to have a memory of my days working on Hadaf and code.af and trying to figure life out.

Thank you for reading till the end.
