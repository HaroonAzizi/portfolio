Thanks for reading this, consider following me on X/Twitter :)

Life is good. I'm always thankful of what I have, it is because I was thought this way as an Afghan. I sometimes think that being too "thankful" is what makes us Afghans not try harder and not trying to make things better. I mean... I got a point, right?

Don't get me wrong, I still am very thankful of what I have and how things are around me. I'm mostly fine, I am trying to be positive and also thankful, but sometimes I feel like I'm living in the lowest days of my life, and it scares me to know that life will get even heavier as a get older. There are some things that I still can't write here since that could cause me problems, but I think this month have been the lowest month of my life.

I think I'm crazy or maybe not "thankful" enough because in February I had two birthday parties, I got a job offer and turned it down, I am currently negotiating on a project for someone, I got another job offer and delayed it for next week (not an offer, but an interview opportunity) and I also made my personal website (this website), purchased three domains and learned some stuff too.

I don't know, I wish for the best and hopefully next time I write about my best days and more positive stuff.

Thanks again for reading and following my [X/Twitter](x.com/az_haroon) :)
